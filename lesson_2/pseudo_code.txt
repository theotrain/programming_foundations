For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

++++ A method that returns the sum of two integers
given 2 numbers
return number1 + number 2


++++ A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
oh god reall code is so much easier here.  Array.join(delimiter)

++++ A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

GIVEN array of strings
SET new_array = []
WHILE iterator < array length

ADD current array item to new+array IF iterator is even number

return new_array
